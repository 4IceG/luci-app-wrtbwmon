# luci-app-wrtbwmon

The origin codes come from Kiougar https://github.com/Kiougar/luci-wrtbwmon.

This repository is the radical overhaul of the original codes which must cooperate with fixed wrtbwmon at the same time. The usable wrtbwmon can be obtained form url https://github.com/brvphoenix/wrtbwmon.

Compared with the original one, this version has made some changes:
1. Recognise the hosts by the unique MAC rather than the IP.
2. Support IPV6 connect which is now imperfected.
3. Can be ran background periodically.
4. Many other details.
